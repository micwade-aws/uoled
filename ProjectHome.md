C# library created to provide a simple interface to the uOLED G1 displays created by 4Dsystems.  Since I only have a uOLED-128-G1, this library is specifically targeted at that platform.




**Shameless plea for help...**<br>
If you have a uOLED-G1-<code>*</code>, and use windows for prototyping, then please have a crack at any of these functions, or just test the code on your display.<br>
